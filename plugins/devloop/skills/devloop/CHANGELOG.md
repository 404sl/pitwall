# Changelog

## 0.1.2

Adds `lock-check.sh`, which answers whether the merge lock is held by something still alive.

It exists because `[ -d $lock ]` was being read as "a lander is running". A lander that dies
without releasing therefore reads as a healthy train forever: the ready-to-land event stops
firing, the drift alarm stays suppressed, and the pipeline goes quiet with green pull requests
queued behind it. That cost 38 minutes and a person going to look, because nothing anywhere
reported an error.

It does not use age, because a legitimate hold can be very long - the lander deploys staging
and production inside the lock, each with a 1500s timeout. It asks instead whether the run that
took the lock is still WRITING, found by attribution rather than by a clock. The pid in the lock
token is deliberately not consulted: it belongs to a shell that has already exited, so `ps -p`
reports a perfectly live lander as gone.


## 0.1.1

**Fixes a regression introduced in 0.1.0.** Removing the hardcoded workspace fallbacks was
right, but `skillDir` had only ever been supplied *by* that fallback - `config.sh --args`
never emitted it. So every lane dispatched the documented way rendered its commands as
`bash undefined/...`.

It degraded silently rather than failing. A lane told to run a script that does not exist
does the steps by hand and the run succeeds, leaving no trace in the outcome. What is lost is
the gate: `lane-handoff.sh` refuses to label a pull request whose checks are empty, failing or
stale, so a lane doing it by hand asserts the label on its own judgement instead. For a Rails
repo `rspec-quiet.sh` is how the suite gets `TEST_ENV_NUMBER`, so without it the run has no
database isolation.

- `config.sh` now derives its own directory and emits `skillDir` from both `--args` and
  `--land`. Derived rather than configured: the install path carries a version segment, so
  anything written down is wrong by the next release.
- The four workflow scripts **refuse** when `skillDir` is absent rather than interpolating
  `undefined`. Silent degradation into a manual path that usually works is worse than a
  failure that stops, because nothing downstream can tell the difference.


## 0.1.0

First published version.

Previously an unpublished skill used across several private workspaces on one machine. This
release is that tool made portable:

- **No workspace defaults.** Every entry point resolved a hardcoded workspace when its
  configuration was absent, which meant a misconfigured run operated on a different project
  entirely - cutting worktrees from it, taking its lane lock, writing into its slot registry -
  while reporting success. They now refuse instead.
- **Harness directories are derived, not named.** The paths used to find live workflow runs
  were one machine's absolute paths, pinned to one project and one session of it. They are now
  computed from the workspace root.
- **Paths inside the skill use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`**, so the plugin works from wherever it
  is installed rather than from one directory.
- **Project-specific examples generalised.** The reasoning in the comments is unchanged - it is
  the most valuable thing here - but the tracker ids and hostnames of the project it grew up in
  have been replaced with neutral ones.
