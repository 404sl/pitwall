# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First published version.

Previously an unpublished skill used across several private workspaces on one machine. This
release is that tool made portable:

- **No workspace defaults.** Every entry point resolved a hardcoded workspace when its
  configuration was absent, which meant a misconfigured run operated on a different project
  entirely - cutting worktrees from it, taking its lane lock, writing into its slot registry -
  while reporting success. They now refuse instead.
- **Harness directories are derived, not named.** The paths used to find live workflow runs
  were one machine's absolute paths, pinned to one project and one session of it. They are now
  computed from the workspace root.
- **Paths inside the skill use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`**, so the plugin works from wherever it
  is installed rather than from one directory.
- **Project-specific examples generalised.** The reasoning in the comments is unchanged - it is
  the most valuable thing here - but the tracker ids and hostnames of the project it grew up in
  have been replaced with neutral ones.
